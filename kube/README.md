# fibber kube deployment

associated containers are generated by travis on successful push to github, with an additional running of tests. 

once minikube and kubectl (and docker and hyperkit) are running locally

- `brew install minikube`
- `brew install hyperkit`
- `minikube start --driver=hyperkit`
- `minikube config set driver hyperkit`

( we can check the ip with `minikube ip` )

we then run:

- `kubectl apply -f client-pod.yaml`
- `kubectl apply -f client-node-port.yaml`

check status with:

- `kubectl get pods`
- `kubectl get services`
