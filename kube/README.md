# fibber kube deployment

associated containers are generated by travis on successful push to github, with an additional running of tests. 

once minikube and kubectl (and docker and hyperkit) are running locally

- `brew install minikube`
- `brew install hyperkit`
- `minikube start --driver=hyperkit`
- `minikube config set driver hyperkit`

( we can check the ip with `minikube ip`, this is the location where we find the exposed ports, not localhost. )

we then run:

- `kubectl apply -f client-pod.yaml`
- `kubectl apply -f client-node-port.yaml`

check status with:

- `kubectl get pods`
- `kubectl get services`

we can kill / delete with:

- `kubectl delete -f client-pod.yaml`

to set up a deployment we make the deployment yaml then apply it:

- `kubectl apply -f client-depolyment.yaml`

to update an image:

- `docker build -t my-docker-name/my-image-name:some-version .`
- (to use the git sha as a version, try `$(git rev-version --verify HEAD)`)
- `docker push my-docker-name/my-image-name:some-version`
- `kubectl set image deployment/(object-name) client=my-docker-name/my-image-name:some-version`

eg:
`pushd ../client\
       && docker build -t downer/fibber-client:$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD) .\
       && docker push downer/fibber-client:$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)\
       && popd\
       && kubectl set image deployment/client-deployment client=downer/fibber-client:$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD)`

to make a secret:
`kubectl create secret generic <secret name> --from-literal key=value` 
where `generic` are arbitrary key-value pairs, `<secret name>` is used to refer to this secret in kube configs
and `--from-literal` means, add the secret in this command as opposed to reading in from a file.
